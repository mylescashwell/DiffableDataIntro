# DiffableDataIntro

This is a tutorial project from the YouTuber: Let's Build That App.

This project showcases the use of UIViewControllerRepresentable, bridging the gap between SwiftUI and UIKit frameworks.
Data is passed between the SwiftUI view & the UIKit ViewController through the use of UIHostingController.

This project was built in an MVVM architecture.
